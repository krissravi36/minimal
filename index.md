# Project 1

This is the project for AI based fraud detection

**Fraud pattern detection:** AI can be used to identify patterns in fraudulent activity that may not be visible to the human eye. For example, AI can be used to identify patterns of credit card fraud by looking for unusual spending patterns or transactions that are made from different locations.

**Customer behavior analysis:** AI can be used to analyze customer behavior patterns to identify potential fraudsters. For example, AI can be used to track how often a customer logs in to their account, what devices they use to access their account, and what times of day they typically make transactions.

**Risk scoring:** AI can be used to assign a risk score to each transaction. This risk score can then be used to decide whether to approve or deny the transaction.
